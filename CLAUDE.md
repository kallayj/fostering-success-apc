This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
  <analysis>
  Let me analyze the conversation chronologically:

  1. Initial Request:
     - The user introduced a project containing free-response problems for AP Physics C courses
     - Content was originally in Google Drive as docx format, partially converted to Markdown
     - Goal: Complete conversion to Markdown and local storage for eventual website hosting

  2. My Initial Analysis:
     - Examined the repository structure, which contains EM_FRQ and Mechanics_FRQ directories
     - Looked at the README.md to understand the project
     - Checked conversion scripts (convert.sh and convert-index.py) to understand the conversion process
     - Found that many files have "Copy of" prefixes and naming inconsistencies

  3. My Report on Conversion Status:
     - Files are organized by physics topic and problem type (LAB, MR, QQT, TBR)
     - Problems and scoring guidelines have been converted to Markdown
     - Index files are in the root directory, but still point to Google Drive links
     - Identified issues: links to Google Drive, file naming inconsistencies, lack of unified navigation

  4. Second User Request:
     - User clarified that index .md files in root directory need to be updated
     - Prompts and scoring guides are already local, but solutions need to be downloaded
     - Solutions need to be downloaded from Google Drive and indexes linked to local files

  5. My Solution Planning:
     - Analyzed the index markdown files to identify Google Drive solution links
     - Created a mapping of Google Drive solution links to where local equivalents should be stored
     - Examined the structure of index markdown files (markdown tables)
     - Determined how links should be updated to point to local files
     - Started to create a script to download solution files and update index files

  At the time of the summary request, I was working on creating a bash script to:
  1. Download all solution files from Google Drive
  2. Update the index files to point to local files

  Key technical aspects included:
  - Challenges with downloading files from Google Drive links (authentication, special handling)
  - Pattern for updating link formats in the markdown index files
  - Directory structure for storing solution files
  </analysis>

  <summary>
  1. Primary Request and Intent:
     The user is working on converting AP Physics C free-response problems from Google Drive (originally in docx format) to a 
  local Markdown repository. The content has been partially converted, with the problem statements and scoring guidelines 
  already in Markdown format. The user specifically requested to:
     - Update the index .md files in the root directory to point to local files instead of Google Drive
     - Download the solutions files (which are still only on Google Drive)
     - Link all indexes to the local files once the solutions are downloaded

  2. Key Technical Concepts:
     - Markdown conversion of educational content
     - Repository structure organization
     - Link management in Markdown files
     - Google Drive file downloading
     - Path standardization
     - File naming conventions
     - Bash scripting for file operations
     - Python scripting for content conversion

  3. Files and Code Sections:
     - `/home/yoni/source/fostering-success-apc/README.md`
       - Provides project overview and background
       - Explains the purpose and organization of physics problems
       - Important for understanding the project's intent and structure
     
     - `/home/yoni/source/fostering-success-apc/convert.sh`
       - Bash script that converts Word documents to Markdown using Pandoc
       - Creates appropriate directory structure and fixes media paths
       - Shows how the initial conversion was performed
       ```bash
       #!/bin/bash
       # Process each .docx file
       for docx_file in "$input_dir"/*.docx; do
           # Get just the filename without extension
           filename=$(basename "$docx_file" .docx)
           # Convert the document
           pandoc "$docx_file" -o "$doc_output_dir/$filename.md" --extract-media="$doc_output_dir"
       ```

     - `/home/yoni/source/fostering-success-apc/convert-index.py`
       - Python script that converts Excel tables to Markdown tables
       - Preserves hyperlinks from the original Excel files
       - Shows how index files were created
       ```python
       for row in list(sheet.iter_rows())[1:]:
           row_text = []
           for cell in row:
               if cell.hyperlink:
                   row_text.append(f"[{cell.value}]({cell.hyperlink.target})")
               else:
                   row_text.append(str(cell.value) if cell.value is not None else "")
       ```

     - `/home/yoni/source/fostering-success-apc/emag_tbr.md` (example index file)
       - Markdown table with links to problems, scoring guidelines, and solutions
       - Currently points to Google Drive rather than local files
       - Target for link updating process
       ```markdown
       | Question ID | Question Title + Link | Summary/Topics | Anticipated Difficulty | Scoring Rubric Link | Solved Out Copy
   Link | Applicable to P2? |
       | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
       | Wisusik.EMAG.TBR.001 | [Bulb Brightness in a Combination 
  Circuit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qmPrjoFeeFfmqxZa-US5se4ny98jc1xDSIKAnxV5V2w/edit?usp=sharing) | Resistive

       ```

  4. Problem Solving:
     - Identified that prompts and scoring guidelines have been converted to Markdown, but solutions are still only on Google 
  Drive
     - Created a comprehensive mapping between Google Drive solution links and where they should be stored locally
     - Determined the format for updating links in the index files:
       - E&M Questions: `./EM_FRQ/Copy of [ID] ([Title])/Copy of [ID] ([Title]).md`
       - E&M Scoring Guidelines: `./EM_FRQ/Scoring_Guidelines/Copy of (SG) [ID]/Copy of (SG) [ID].md`
       - Mechanics Questions: `./Mechanics_FRQ/[ID] ([Title])/[ID] ([Title]).md`
       - Mechanics Scoring Guidelines: `./Mechanics_FRQ/Scoring_Guidelines/(SG) [ID]/(SG) [ID].md`
     - Noted a potential challenge with downloading files from Google Drive due to authentication requirements

  5. Pending Tasks:
     - Create a script to download solution files from Google Drive
     - Create appropriate directories for storing solutions locally
     - Update all index files to point to local files instead of Google Drive links
     - Address file naming inconsistencies (e.g., "Copy of" prefixes, "Wisuisik" vs "Wisusik")

  6. Current Work:
     When the summary was requested, I was in the process of creating a bash script that would:
     1. Create necessary directories for solution files
     2. Download the solution files from Google Drive
     3. Update the index files with correct local paths
     
     I had identified all the Google Drive solution links (~60 files) that needed to be downloaded and determined where they 
  should be stored locally. I was about to address the technical challenges of downloading files from Google Drive links, 
  which often require authentication or special handling.

  7. Optional Next Step:
     The next step would be to complete the script for downloading solution files from Google Drive and updating index links. 
  However, before proceeding, it would be valuable to discuss the challenges with Google Drive downloads, as these links may 
  require authentication or special handling that can't be easily automated with simple curl requests. We might need to 
  consider:
     
     1. Whether the user has the ability to download these files manually first
     2. If there's an API key or authentication method available
     3. Determining if the files are publicly accessible or require permissions

     This comes directly from the task I was working on: "Please create a bash script that will: 1. Create necessary 
  directories for the solution files 2. Download the solution files from Google Drive (noting any limitations) 3. Update the 
  index files with the correct local paths"
