Welcome,

Here are some free response questions I’ve written for AP Physics C, aligned with the new style of the 2025 exams. Overall, these questions lean toward the more straightforward/easier side, as I’m still developing my skills in crafting the truly odd and novel scenarios we all love (and students hate to see in May).

If you teach AP Physics 1 or 2, I’ve tried to note which questions might be useful for your courses—many of the problems do not require calculus.

## Background and Usage

Every question, figure, and scoring guideline was created by me (although I certainly took inspiration from past problems I’ve seen). Feel free to use these questions however you'd like, both in and out of the classroom, with no need for credit (though please don’t try to claim them as your own).
For those curious: the E&M figures were made in PowerPoint, while the Mechanics figures were generated using LaTeX (with some coding help from ChatGPT). I personally use these for unit tests, homework, and formative assessments. One day, I’d love to collect performance data to better calibrate their difficulty. While these questions are publicly available and thus not “secure,” I imagine it would still take quite a bit of effort for a student to actually find them.

## The Index

The master index is the most useful resource. The Mechanics tab is organized by topic, and it's self-explanatory. The E&M tab is not sorted, but within each category, the questions generally follow the content sequence: circuits → electrostatics → magnetism → induction. Each row links directly to the question and scoring guidelines. I’ve done my best to simulate realistic point values, but I’ll have a better sense of scoring after the AP Reading in June.

## Extra Stuff

I always appreciate feedback and take requests. If you have corrections, questions, or even just a topic you'd like to see a question on, feel free to reach out: fosterwisusik@gmail.com. I’m usually quick to reply as I love talking AP physics!

My long-term aim is to build a portfolio and eventually work as a question writer or content designer for AP. If you know how to get involved in that world, I’d be grateful for any guidance.

These resources will always be free. That said, if you’d like to support my work with a small donation, my Venmo is @fosterwisusik (last four digits: 4262, picture is me in my college marching band).

Hopefully these questions help you “foster success” on the exam.
