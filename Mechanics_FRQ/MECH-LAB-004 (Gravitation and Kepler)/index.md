3.) A group of students are exploring a simulation that models Newton's
Law of Universal Gravitation. In this simulation, students can vary the
masses (in kilograms) of two objects, along with their center-to-center
separation (in meters). The simulation then displays the magnitude of
the gravitational force between the two masses (in Newtons). The
students wish to determine whether the value of the gravitational
constant used in the simulation is equal to the accepted value used in
real-world calculations.

a.) **Design** an experimental procedure the students could use to
collect data that would allow them to use a linear graph to determine
whether the value of the simulation's gravitational constant is
consistent with real-world data. Clearly explain how the students should
use the simulation to collect the necessary data.

b.) **Describe** how the data could be analyzed to determine whether the
value of the gravitational constant used in the simulation is equal to
the accepted value used in real-world calculations.

c.) Another group of students compile a list of the orbital distances
$d$ and periods $T$ of several satellites in circular orbit around
Earth. Each orbital distance is measured from Earth's center.
