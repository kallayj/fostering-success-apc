**Highest Possible Score:** 8 Points

a.) 3 Points

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  For indicating that the cyclist's average speed will be lower  1 Point
  on the windy day                                               
  -------------------------------------------------------------- --------
  For a justification stating the times of each segment are not  1 Point
  equal                                                          

  For a justification stating that the cyclist spends more time  1 Point
  biking against the wind                                        
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

*[Example Solution]{.underline}*

-   *The average speed of the cyclist will be lower on a windy day*

-   *Even though the cyclist experiences equal changes in speed, the
    distance of each segment is the same, not the time*

-   *As a result, the cyclist spends more time biking at the slower
    speed in order to travel the required distance, which is lower than
    their original speed* $v$

-   *Thus, the cyclist's average speed on a windy day will be lower than
    their speed on a day without wind*

*[Example Solution]{.underline}*

$v_{avg} =$ $\frac{d_{Tot}}{t_{Tot}}$

$t_{Tot} = t_{with} + t_{against}$

$=$ $\frac{d}{v + w}$ $+$ $\frac{d}{v - w}$

$v_{avg} =$ $\frac{2d}{\frac{d}{v + w}\  + \ \frac{d}{v - w}}$

$v_{avg} =$$\ \frac{2}{\frac{1}{v + w}\  + \ \frac{1}{v - w}}$

$=$$\ \frac{2}{\frac{2v}{v^{2} - w^{2}}}$

$=$$\ \frac{v^{2} - w^{2}}{v}$

$v_{avg} = \ v -$ $\frac{w^{2}}{v}$

c.) 2 Points

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  For a valid claim about the consistency of the previous parts  1 Point
  -------------------------------------------------------------- --------
  For a valid justification                                      1 Point

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

*[Example Solution]{.underline}*

-   *The previous two parts are consistent with one another*

-   *From part (b.),* $v_{avg} = \ v -$ $\frac{w^{2}}{v}$

-   *The derived expression in part (b.) states that the average speed
    of the cyclist is equal to their speed on a day without wind* $(v)$
    *minus a factor of* $\frac{w^{2}}{v}$

-   *This means that the cyclist\'s speed will always be lower than*
    $v$*, so their speed must be lower on a windy day, as claimed in
    part (a.)*
