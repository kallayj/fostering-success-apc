1.) Three identical charges $+ q$ are placed along the vertices of an
equilateral triangle with side length *s*, as shown in the figure below

b.) Suppose the top charge is released from rest, while the bottom
charges remain stationary. **Derive** an expression for the velocity $v$
of the top charge once it reaches a distance very far away from the
other two point charges, given that the charge $q$ has a mass $m$. Begin
your derivation by writing a fundamental physics principle or an
equation from the reference book.
