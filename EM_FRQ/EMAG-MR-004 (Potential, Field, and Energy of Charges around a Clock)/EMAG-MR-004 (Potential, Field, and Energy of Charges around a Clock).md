1.) Twelve point charges are placed at equal distances around a circle
of radius $R$. The charges at the "twelve-o'clock" and "three-o'clock"
positions have a charge $+ q$, while the rest of the charges have a
value of $- q$, as shown in the figure below

a.)

b.) Suppose all of the negative charges are removed, leaving only the
two positive charges. These final two charges are then released from
rest and allowed to move apart.

Given that each charge has a mass $M$, **derive** an expression for the
speed of each charge after their separation distance becomes infinitely
large.
