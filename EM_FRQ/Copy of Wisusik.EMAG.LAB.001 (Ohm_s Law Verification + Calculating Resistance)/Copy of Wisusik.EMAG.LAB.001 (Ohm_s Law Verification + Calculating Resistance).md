*Suggested Time: 25-30 minutes*

3.) A group of students are given a new type of incandescent lightbulb,
and wish to determine whether or not the light bulb is ohmic.
Additionally, the students have access to a variable power supply,
digital multimeters, and standard circuit equipment.

a.) **Design** an experimental procedure the students could use to
collect data that would allow them to make a graph to determine whether
or not the light bulb follows Ohm's Law. Clearly explain how the
equipment presented above should be used to collect the necessary
measurements, and provide enough detail so that the experiment could be
replicated, including any steps necessary to reduce experimental
uncertainty.

b.) **Describe** how the data could be analyzed to determine whether or
not the light bulb is ohmic

c.) Another group of students are given a resistor (which is known to
follow Ohm's Law), and they wish to calculate its resistance $R$. The
students place the resistor in a water bath initially at 0Â° C, and run a
constant current $I$ through the resistor for a fixed time period of two
minutes. By measuring the final temperature of the water, the students
are able to calculate the energy dissipated $E$ by the resistor during
the two minute interval. Before each successive trial, the water bath is
returned to its original state. The students' data for a variety of
input currents is shown in the table below:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  $I\ (A)$          $E\ (J\  \times 10^{4})$                     
  ----------------- -------------------------- ----------------- -----------------
  1.0               0.99                                         

  1.1               1.20                                         

  1.2               1.47                                         

  1.3               1.67                                         

  1.4               1.86
