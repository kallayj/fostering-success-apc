1.) Consider a conducting slab with a square base of side length $s$ and
thickness $\Delta x\ $as shown in the figure below. The slab carries a
constant current $I$, and there is a uniform electric field of magnitude
$E$ that points to the left at all points inside of the slab.

b.) A voltmeter is connected to opposite ends of the slab, as shown
below.

**Determine** the magnitude of the reading $\Delta V$ on the voltmeter,
and indicate which side of the slab is at a higher electric potential.
**Justify** your answer.
