2.) The circuit shown below contains an initially uncharged capacitor.
Resistance values, capacitance values, and the battery voltage are shown
below. At time $t = 0$, the switch is moved to the position labeled 1.

a.) On the diagram below, **draw** a quantitatively accurate bar graph
showing the potential difference across the $2R$ resistor, the $3R$
resistor, and the capacitor of capacitance $C$ after the switch has been
placed in position 1 for a long time.

b.) A long time $T$ after the switch has been connected in position 1,
the switch is moved to position 2. By writing and solving an appropriate
differential equation, **derive** an expression for the potential
difference across the capacitor as a function of the time $t'$ elapsed
since $t = T$. Begin your derivation by writing a fundamental physics
principle or an equation from the reference book.

c.) **Sketch** a graph of the current $I$ through the branch of the
circuit containing the capacitor for all times $t$. Define a downward
current to be positive. **Label** explicitly the value of the current at
times $t = 0$ and $t = T$ (once the switch is first moved to position
2)![](media/image2.png){width="5.199730971128609in"

d.) Suppose the graph above was generated in a lab using computer
software. **Describe** how the graph drawn in part (c.) could be used to
calculate the total charge on one plate of the capacitor at $t = T$,
assuming the value of $C$ was unknown. **Justify** your answer.
