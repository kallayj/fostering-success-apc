4.) Three resistors, labeled A, B, and C, are placed in the circuit
shown below which is powered by an ideal battery of emf $\varepsilon$.
The resistance values of A, B, and C are known to be $R$, $2R$, and
$6R$,
respectively.![](media/image1.png){width="6.322101924759405in"

a.) **Rank** the currents passing through each resistor, denoted by
$I_{A}$, $I_{B}$, and $I_{C}$. **Justify** your answer without
manipulating equations

b.) **Derive** expressions for $I_{A}$, $I_{B}$, and $I_{C}$. Begin your
derivation by writing a fundamental physics principle or an equation
from the reference book.

c.) **Justify** whether the equations derived in part (b) either agree
or disagree with your ranking in part (a)
