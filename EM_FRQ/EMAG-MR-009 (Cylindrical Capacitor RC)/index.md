1.) A cylindrical capacitor is constructed using two concentric
conducting cylinders holding equal and opposite charges along their
equal lengths $l$. The inner cylinder holds a charge $- Q$ and has a
radius $R$, while the outer cylinder holds a charge $+ Q$ and has an
inner radius of $3R$.

b.) The capacitor is charged before being connected in series to an open
switch and three identical resistances $r$ wired in parallel with one
another. The switch is then closed at $t = 0$.

i.) **Derive** a differential equation that could be solved to give the
amount of charge $q$ on one of the cylinders as a function of time in
terms of $r$ and $C$

ii.) **Derive** an expression for the time $t_{1/2}$ required for the
capacitor to release half of its initial stored charge in terms of $r$
and $C$.
