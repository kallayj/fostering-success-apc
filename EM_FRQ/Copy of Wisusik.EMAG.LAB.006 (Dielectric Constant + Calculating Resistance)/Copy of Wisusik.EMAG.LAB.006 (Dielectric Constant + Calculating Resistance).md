3.) A group of students wish to experimentally determine the dielectric
constant of a type of insulating plastic. The students have access to a
large supply of the plastic, aluminum foil, and a capacitance meter in
addition to the standard equipment available in a physics laboratory.

a.) **Design** an experimental procedure the students could use to
collect data that would allow them to calculate the dielectric constant
of the plastic using a graph. Clearly explain how the equipment
presented above should be used to collect the necessary measurements,
and. Provide enough detail so that the experiment could be replicated,
including any steps necessary to reduce experimental uncertainty.

b.) **Describe** how the data could be analyzed using a graph to
calculate the dielectric constant of the plastic.

c.) Another group of students use a charged $40\ \mu F$ capacitor to
calculate the internal resistance $R$ of a voltmeter. The students
connect the capacitor to the voltmeter, and allow the capacitor to
discharge through the voltmeter beginning at $t = 0$. The students
record the voltage $V$ across the capacitor every 20 seconds, as shown
in the table below.

  Time (s)          Voltage (V)

  40                6.24                                

  60                4.12                                

  80                3.33
