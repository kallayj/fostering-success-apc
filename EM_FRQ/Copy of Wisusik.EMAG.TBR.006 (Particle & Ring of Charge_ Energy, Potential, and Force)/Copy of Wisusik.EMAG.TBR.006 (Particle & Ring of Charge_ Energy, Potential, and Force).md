2.) A stationary, thin conducting ring of radius $R$ is centered around
$x = 0$, and contains a negative linear charge density $- \lambda$ which
is distributed uniformly across its length.

A point particle with mass $m$ and charge $+ q$ is placed at Point
$P_{1}$, which is located at a very small rightward displacement
$x = \  + D$ along the ring's central axis. The particle is released
from rest at Point $P_{1}$, and later passes through Point $P_{2}$,
which is located at the center of the ring.

a.) **Draw** a qualitatively accurate energy bar chart showing the
relative amounts of electric potential energy $U_{E}$ and kinetic energy
$K$ of the particle-ring system at each of the points shown in the
figure, defining the potential energy to be equal to zero an infinite
distance from the ring.\

b.) **Derive** an expression for the speed of the particle as it passes
through the center of the ring. Begin your derivation with a fundamental
physics principle or equation from the reference book

c.) **Draw** a qualitatively accurate graph of the net electrostatic
force $F_{E}$ acting on the particle as a function of its position $x$
along the central axis of the ring. Define a rightward force to be
positive, and assume the displacement $D$ is much smaller than the
radius of the ring.

d.) Will the particle ever reach a distance infinitely far from the
ring? **Justify** your answer using the graph drawn in part (c.)
