2.) Three identical light bulbs of resistance $R$, labeled A, B, and C,
are placed in a circuit containing an ideal battery of emf
$\varepsilon$, as shown in the diagram below.

a.) **Draw** an energy bar chart showing the relative magnitude of the
*potential difference* across each of the three bulbs. The exact value
of each potential drop does not need to be
accurate.![](media/image4.png){width="4.49293416447944in"

b.) **Derive** an expression for the power dissipated by Bulb A. Begin
your derivation by writing a fundamental physics principle or an
equation from the reference book.

c.) A graph showing the total energy dissipated by Bulb A as a function
of time is shown below. On the same set of axes, **sketch** a
qualitatively accurate graph showing the energy dissipated by Bulb C as
a function of time.

d.) Suppose the circuit is slightly modified by adding another battery
of emf $\varepsilon$ in series with the original battery.

Let the total power dissipated by the bulbs in the original circuit be
denoted as $P_{1}$, and the total power dissipated by the bulbs in this
new circuit be denoted as $P_{2}$

**Determine** the ratio $\frac{P_{2}}{P_{1}}$, with justification
