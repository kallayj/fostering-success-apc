*Suggested Time: 20-25 minutes*

**1.)** A current-carrying cylinder of length $l$ and cross sectional
diameter $d$ is placed in a simple circuit containing an ideal battery,
as shown in the figure below. The cylinder carries a current parallel to
its length, and when at room temperature, the cylinder carries a current
density given by $J(r) = \ ar^{- 1}$, where $r$ is the distance from the
central axis of cylinder, and $a$ is a constant. You may assume Ohm's
Law holds.

a.)

i.) On the figure below, draw **two** distinct labeled arrows indicating
the direction of the *both* the electric field $E$ and conventional
current flow $I$ inside of the cylinder.

b.) Suppose the cylinder from the previous part carries a total current
$I_{Tot}$, and has a resistivity that varies along its length by the
expression $\rho$$(x) = \ b(x + 1)$, where $x$ represents the horizontal
distance from the left end of the cylinder, and $b$ is a constant.
**Write**, but do not evaluate, an integral expression that can be
evaluated to give the emf $\varepsilon$ of the battery. Begin your
derivation by writing a fundamental physics principle or an equation
from the reference book.
