1.) In the charge distribution shown below, a positive charge $+ Q$ is
placed in the center of a hollow spherical cavity of radius $R$. This
hollow cavity is surrounded by a concentric spherical conducting shell
of inner radius $R$ and outer radius $3R$ as measured from the center of
the cavity. A cross section view of this distribution is shown below.

a.) It is known that the shell holds a net negative charge $- 9Q$.

> i.) **Derive** an expression for the charge on the outer surface of

> ii.) When the electric field is measured at a distance $4R$ from the

> **Derive** an expression for the absolute value of $Q$ in terms of $E$
> and physical constants starting from Gauss's Law. Begin your

b.) Consider Point P, which is placed at a distance $\frac{R}{2}$ from
the center of the cavity.

> i\) On the diagram below, **draw** the direction of the electric field
> at Point P, and **draw** the cross section of an equipotential surface
> containing Point P. If the electric field is zero, write $E = 0$ on
> Point P.
