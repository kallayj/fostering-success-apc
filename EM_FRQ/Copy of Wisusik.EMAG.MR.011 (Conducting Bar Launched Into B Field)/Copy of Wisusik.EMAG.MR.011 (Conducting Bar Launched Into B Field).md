*Suggested Time: 20-25 minutes*

1.) A bulb of resistance $R$ and a conducting bar of mass $m$ and are
placed on a set of wire rails separated by a width $w$. At $t = 0$, the
bar is launched to the right at an initial velocity $v_{0}$ into a
region constant magnetic field with magnitude $B$ directed into the
plane of the figure below.

a.) After the bar is launched, there are no forces assisting the bar's
rightward motion. Consider the moment in time when the bar is moving at
a velocity $v$ to the right:

b.) A long time after the bar is launched, it will come to a stop.
**Derive** an expression for minimum horizontal length of the rails
required to ensure that the bar can come to a complete stop without
falling off. Assume that the bar is launched from the left end of the
rails, and has negligible width.
