3.) Suppose a group of students are presented with two vertically
aligned parallel wires of known length $l$ that are carrying equal
horizontal currents $I$ that can be turned on and off using a switch
(not shown). The students can adjust the distance $d$ between the wires
using strings of adjustable length, and have access to a force sensor.
The students wish to determine the value of $I$ without disconnecting
any element of the circuit. The students do not have multimeters. The
experimental setup is shown below.

a.) **Design** an experimental procedure the students could use to
collect data that would allow them to use a graph to calculate the value
of the current $I$ carried by each wire. Clearly explain how the
equipment presented above should be used to collect the necessary
measurements.

b.) **Describe** how the data could be analyzed using a graph to
calculate the value of $I$

c.) Another group of students are attempting to use a solenoid to
calculate the value of the vacuum permeability $\mu_{0}$. In their
experiment, the students vary the length $l$ of a metal coil with a
constant $N =$ 100 turns, and record the magnetic field strength $B$ in
the center of the coil after supplying a constant current of
$I = 0.75\ A$. The data collected by the students is shown below.

  0.6               170                                 

  0.8               130

d.) Using the line drawn in part (c)(ii) along with the given values of
$N = 100$ and $I = 0.75\ A$, **calculate** an experimental value for
$\mu_{0}$
