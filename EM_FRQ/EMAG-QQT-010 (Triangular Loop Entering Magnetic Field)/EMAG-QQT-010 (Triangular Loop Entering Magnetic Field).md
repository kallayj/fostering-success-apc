4.) A loop of wire with total resistance $R$ is formed in the shape of
an isosceles right triangle with legs of length $a$. The loop is pulled
at a constant velocity $v$ through a region of magnetic field
perpendicular to the plane of the loop with a magnitude $B$. The
magnetic field spans a horizontal distance of $2a$.

a.) **Rank** the magnitude of the induced current in the loop at each
time, $I(t_{1})$, $I(t_{2})$, and $I(t_{3})$. Include
equality/inequality signs where appropriate.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

Lowest Current Highest Current

**Justify** your ranking without referencing equations.

b.) **Derive** an expression for the induced current in the loop when
the right tip of the loop is at a position $x$ from the left end of the
magnetic field region, where $0 \leq x \leq a$

c.) Suppose that instead, the triangular loop is replaced with a square
loop of side length $a$ and the same total resistance $R$.

i.) **Compare** the total energy $E$ dissipated while each loop is fully
pulled into the region of magnetic field from outside at a constant
speed $v$
