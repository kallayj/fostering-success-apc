1.) A long, insulating rod of length $2L$ is centered on the $x$-axis.
The rod carries negative charge with a nonuniform linear charge density
given by $\lambda(x) = \  -$ $e^{- x^{2}}$ for $- L < x < L$

a.) Suppose we are interested in the net electric field generated by the
charged rod

> i.) On the diagram above, **Draw** the direction of the net electric
> field at each of the three points given.
>
> ii.) **Derive** (but do not evaluate) an integral expression that
> gives the total charge on the rod.

iii.) **Derive** (but do not evaluate) an integral expression that would
yield the magnitude of the net electric field at Point A, which is a
vertical distance $a$ above the midpoint of the rod. Begin your
derivation by writing a fundamental physics principle or an equation
from the reference book.

b.) **Suppose** the original rod is replaced by another insulating rod
of the same length $2L$, but holding a total charge $+ Q$ uniformly
distributed throughout its length. **Derive** an expression for the the
electric potential at Point B, which is a horizontal distance $b$ from
the left end of the rod, assuming the electric potential to be zero at
infinity. Begin your derivation by writing a fundamental physics
principle or an equation from the reference book.
