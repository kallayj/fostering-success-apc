4.) A capacitor is constructed using two parallel plates of area $A$
that are separated by a distance $d$. An insulating material of
dielectric constant $\kappa$ is inserted between the plates which spans
the entire distance between the plates, but only half of the total area.
The capacitor is charged using a battery, and then the battery is
disconnected.

a.) Suppose that after the capacitor is charged and the battery is
disconnected, the dielectric is also removed by an external agent.

**Indicate** whether the energy stored by the capacitor will increase,
decrease, or remain constant after the dielectric is removed.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ The stored energy will increase

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ The stored energy will decrease

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ The stored energy will remain constant

**Justify** your answer without referencing equations.

b.) Let $U_{0}$ represent the potential energy stored by the capacitor
once the dielectric is removed, and $U_{\kappa}$ represent the potential
energy stored by the capacitor with the dielectric inserted. **Derive**
an expression for the ratio $\frac{U_{0}}{U_{\kappa}}$ in terms of
$\kappa$

c.) Let $C_{1}$ represent the capacitor with the dielectric inserted in
its original orientation. Suppose in a new capacitor $C_{2}$ of
identical geometry, the dielectric now spans the entire area of the
capacitor plates, but only half of the plate separation.

If both capacitors are isolated and given equal initial charges before
being connected to the same resistive load, which capacitor will take
longer to release half of its stored energy? **Justify** your answer.
