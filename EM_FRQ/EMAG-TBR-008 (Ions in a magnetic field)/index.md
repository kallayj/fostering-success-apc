2.) A particle beam sends a stream of positively charged hydrogen nuclei
into a region of magnetic field of magnitude $B$ directed out of the
page. Within this region, there are detector plates constructed to
record the vertical distances $\Delta y$ at which charged particles
strike the plates directly above/below to their entry point.

Consider the following two types of hydrogen nuclei that are sent into
the region of magnetic field at the same speed $v_{0}$ chosen via a
velocity selector:

-   Protium ($H^{1}$) has mass $m$ and charge $+ e$

-   Deuterium $(H^{2})$ has mass $2m$ and charge $+ e$

a.) On the diagram below, **draw** the approximate paths taken by each
ion. **Label** the paths of each ion using the respective labels $H^{1}$
and $H^{2}$

b.) Suppose the $H^{1}$ ions strike the detector at a vertical distance
$\Delta y_{1}$. **Derive** an expression for the time $t$ the $H^{1}$
ions spend in the magnetic field in terms of $B,m,e,$ $\Delta y_{1},$
and any appropriate constants. Begin your derivation by writing a
fundamental physics principle or an equation from the reference book.

c.) **Sketch** a graph showing how the striking distance $\Delta y$
depends on an ion's mass $m$. **Label** any known intercepts.

d.) Is your graph in part (c.) consistent with your drawings in part
(a.)? **Justify** your choice
