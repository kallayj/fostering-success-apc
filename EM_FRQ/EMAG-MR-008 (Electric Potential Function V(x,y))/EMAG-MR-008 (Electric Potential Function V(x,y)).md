1.) The electric potential in the xy-plane is given by
$V(x,y) = x^{2} + 4y^{2}$

a.) Consider the following subset of the
xy-plane:![](media/image1.png){width="5.1885422134733155in"
height="5.145393700787402in"}

> i.) On the figure above, **draw** the equipotential curve containing
> the point $(0,a)$, and **draw** the direction of the electric field at
> that point.
>
> ii.) A particle of charge $- q$ is placed at the point $(0,a)$.
> **Derive** an expression for the magnitude of the particle's change in
> electric potential energy $\Delta U$ as it is moved to the point
> $(2a,0)$
>
> iii.) **Derive** an expression for the magnitude of the net electric
> field at the point $(b,b)$

b.) Suppose another particle of charge $+ q$ is moved along the circle
$x^{2} + y^{2} = r^{2}$.

> i.) Is this curve an equipotential? **Justify** your answer.
>
> ii.) **Determine** the value of
> $\oint_{}^{}\overrightarrow{E} \cdot d\overrightarrow{l}$ as the
> particle is moved to complete one full revolution around the circle in
> the clockwise direction
